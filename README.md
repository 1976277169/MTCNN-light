# MTCNN-light
Introduction
this repository is the implementation of MTCNN with no framework,  Just need opencv and openblas.
"Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks", implemented with C++ï¼Œno framework
it is very easy for you to use.
it is can be a part of your project with no framework, like caffe and mxnet.
it is real time for VGA, and you can improve it's runtime.

Time Cost
The average time cost is 27ms/frame(640*480).The result is generated by testing a camera.
