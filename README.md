# MTCNN-light
## Introduction
this repository is the implementation of MTCNN with no framework,  Just need opencv and openblas.  
"Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks", implemented with C++ï¼Œno framework  
it is very easy for you to use.  
it is can be a part of your project with no framework, like caffe and mxnet.  
it is real time for VGA, and you can improve it's runtime.  

## Time Cost
The average time cost is 27ms/frame(640*480).The result is generated by testing a camera.   
cpu   i5-4590  
os    ubuntu14.04   64bit

## Dependencies
opencv  2.0+  
openblas  

### opencv install 
you can find many tutorials.

### openblas
It is very easy to install  
1 download the source code from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS  
2 Extract it and type "cd xxx", xxx means the directory  
3 type "make"   
4 type "make install PREFIX=your_installation_directory"   

### if you don't have cmake 
apt-get install cmake

## usage
cd root_directory   
vim CMakeLists.txt   
change   include_directories(the_directory_of_openblas_include_of_yours)  
change   link_directories(the_directory_of_openblas_lib_of_yours)  
save and exit

cmake .   
make   
./main
